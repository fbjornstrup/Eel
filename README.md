## Welcome to the life of an average Eel from Stenløse

The [Eel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eel) is a ray-finned fish belonging to the order Anguilliformes, which consists of eight suborders, 19 families, 111 genera, and about 800 species. It is most commonly found around a small town on Sjælland called [Stenløse](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenl%C3%B8se), where it is most often spotted at the local playground. During the mating season however, it is known for moving more east of Sjælland, and is to be found around Skindergade and Kattesundet, where it haunts its prey.
